# S107 - DevOps
Repository with the project of the S107 (DevOps) subject of Inatel.

- The goal is to apply the concepts of pipeline (with Actions), running unit tests, generating artifacts and sending notifications.

- The main code is a simple *sum* function, just to focus on the priority which is the pipeline (Actions) itself.
